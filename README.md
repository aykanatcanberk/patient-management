## üß± Architecture Overview

The system consists of the following microservices:

- **Patient Service**
  - Handles patient creation, update, deletion
  - Calls Billing Service via gRPC
  - Sends Kafka events for analytics
- **Billing Service**
  - Acts as a gRPC server
  - Handles billing logic triggered by patient events
- **Analytics Service**
  - Consumes Kafka events
  - Processes and stores analytical data
- **Auth Service**
  - Manages login and JWT token generation/validation
- **API Gateway**
  - Single entry point to all services
  - Includes authentication filters
